# Competency Assessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to produce readable and efficient code that is easily extensible. Your ability to incorporate design principles into your code is key.

### Task
This repository contains the code for a python script that processes a fictitious order. You are expected to read the code and gain an understanding of what the application does.

Your are required to:

1. Use SOLID design principles to update the script (including your additions) so that there is low coupling and high cohesion, making the code easily extensible. (30)
2. Extend the application so that it can process a new payment type called "PayPal", that requires an email address instead of a security code. (10)
3. Ensure that your code is well documented. (5)
