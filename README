# Competency Assessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to produce easily readable and efficient code that is easily
extendable. Your ability to incorporate design principles into your code is key. You will have 48 hours to complete
the assessment and are free to utilise any online resource or knowledge base.

### Task
This repository contains the code for a python script that processes a fictitious order. You are expected to read the
code and gain an understanding of what the application does.

Your are required to:

1. Use SOLID design principles to update scripts (including your additions) so that there is low coupling and high cohesion, making the code easily extensible. (20)
2. Extend the application so that it can process a new payment type called "PayPal", that requires an email address instead of a security code. (5)
3. Ensure that your code is well documented. (5)
